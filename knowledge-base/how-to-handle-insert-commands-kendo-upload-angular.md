## Description

When working with the Kendo UI Upload for Angular, I need to handle insert operations effectively. Specifically, I want to know how to retrieve and manage the inserted item during an insert command event.

## Solution

To handle insert operations in Kendo UI Upload for Angular, follow these steps:

1. **Capture the Insert Command Event**: First, ensure you have an event listener for the insert command. This will trigger whenever an insert operation is initiated.
   
2. **Access the Inserted Item**: Use the `GridEditFormInsertItem` class to access the inserted item. This can be done within the event handler for the insert command.

   Example:

   ```typescript
   protected onInsertCommand(event: any): void {
       let insertedItem = event.item; // Access your inserted item here
       // Perform operations with the insertedItem
   }
   ```

3. **Perform Additional Operations**: Once you have access to the inserted item, you can perform your required operations, such as updating the UI or sending the item to a server.

4. **Refer to Additional Documentation**: For further details on handling insert, update, and delete operations at the database level, refer to the [Telerik documentation](http://www.telerik.com/help/aspnet-ajax/grdinsertupdatedeleteatdatabaselevel.html).

Remember, the exact implementation details might vary depending on the specific features and configuration of your Kendo UI Upload for Angular setup. Adjust the code snippets above to fit your application's requirements.

## Notes

- The `GridEditFormInsertItem` is a conceptual representation and may not directly apply to Kendo UI Upload for Angular. Instead, focus on the event handling pattern described.
- Always test insert operations to ensure they work as expected in your specific application context.
